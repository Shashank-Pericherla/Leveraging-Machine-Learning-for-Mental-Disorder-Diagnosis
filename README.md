# Mental-Disorder-Diagnosis
Leveraging Machine Learning for enhanced mental disorder diagnosis using QEEG

## About this Project  

Mental disorders affect a significant portion of the population, and accurate diagnosis is crucial for effective treatment. Traditional diagnostic methods often rely on subjective assessments, which can be time-consuming and prone to bias. This research project investigates the potential of EEG signals, which measure electrical activity generated by eye movements, as biomarkers for mental disorder diagnosis.

## Objective
* Analyze the features extracted from EEG signals that contribute most significantly to the classification.
* Explore the potential of EEG-based diagnosis as a non-invasive and objective tool for mental health assessment.
* Develop a machine learning model that can classify different mental disorders using EEG signals.
* Evaluate the model's performance in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

  
## Dataset Description:  
* The dataset consists of background information about the patients and the Quantitative values of their EEG.  
* The dataset is derived from a total of 945 patients.  
* The disorder features present 7 classes of the disorders the patients are diagnosed with.

## Methodology

* Data Acquisition:
  * The QEEG dataset has been retrieved from osf.io/8bsvr

* Data Preprocessing:
  * Cleaning and pre-processing the EEG data to remove noise.
  * Extracting important feature using feature selection.
  * Normalizing the data.
  * Over sampling the minority classes in the dataset.

* Model Development:
  * Choosing the appropriate model.
  * Training the model on a portion of the data and evaluating its performance on a separate testing set.

* Evaluation and Analysis:
  * Evaluating the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
  * Analyzing the features with the highest importance scores to understand their role in the classification process.
